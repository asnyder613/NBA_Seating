- Each NBA team has to price thousands of single game tickets for 41 home games and then update the price in real time to align with the secondary market.
- Given anonymized historical ticket prices, matchup info and seat location calculate a seat quality score.
- Use the seat quality score and given market data to assign the optimal ticket price to unsold inventory.
